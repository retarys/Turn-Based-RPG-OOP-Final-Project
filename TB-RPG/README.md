
This project is a turn-based role-playing game (RPG) developed in Java. It uses the Swing library to create a graphical user interface, enabling the player to select characters, view enemy stats, and take turns attacking enemies in a structured level-based system. This RPG project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in practice.


As a part of my final project for the class i've been instructed to to develop a project in Java to showcase my understanding of the OOP principles. While working on this project my understanding of the Java language and the principles of OOP have been improved, i look forward to working on other projects to develop my skills
